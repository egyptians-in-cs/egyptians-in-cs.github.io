"""Google Scholar lookups, used sparingly.

Scholar has no API and blocks anything that looks like bulk scraping — a pass
over the whole directory fails on more than half of it. So the pipeline only
ever asks about a handful of researchers at a time:

  * the h-index gate on a new submission (a few lookups per fetch)
  * `refresh`, which takes the N stalest entries and stops at the first sign
    of being throttled

Nothing here retries aggressively; being blocked is a reason to come back
later, not to push harder.
